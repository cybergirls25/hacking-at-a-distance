# Robot Control Scripts

This folder includes scripts used to control the Raspberry Pi-based robot.

## Contents
- `robot_movement_control.py` – Core script to control robot movement (forward, backward, left, right).
- `test_robot_script.py` – A testing script used to verify GPIO pin setup and motor functions.

These scripts allow the robot to move autonomously or via a web-based control panel to execute wireless attacks.
