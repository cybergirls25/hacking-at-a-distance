# IDS

This folder includes scripts and data used to implement a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting wireless USB-based attacks.

## Contents
- `Rule_Based_IDS.py` – Core script that defines rules to detect suspicious USB behavior such as MouseJack and HID injection attacks.
- `data_combined.csv` – A combined dataset containing both benign and malicious USB activity used for detection and evaluation.
- `full_IDS.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook version of the IDS implementation, with visualizations and step-by-step analysis.
- `README.md` – Documentation describing the IDS project and its components.

These files are part of a system designed to detect wireless-based USB threats using rule-based logic and behavioral patterns.
